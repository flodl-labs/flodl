//! `fdl publish` — put a run where the fleet can pull it.
//!
//! The controller side of compiling on the node. It resolves a source
//! spec into a served directory, builds it once, and writes the run
//! manifest workers read. Chaining trainings on a standing fleet is then
//! one command: publish again and every box picks the new run up on its
//! next dial, with nothing to edit on any worker.
//!
//! **The build is validation, not an artifact.** One build gates the
//! publish; each worker still compiles its own, because a controller
//! producing binaries for N worker variants is the build matrix this
//! design deleted. A gate needs no GPU libtorch either — compiling
//! without a GPU feature against the cheap CPU variant catches user-code
//! errors just as well — so the cost of having it on by default is
//! rustup plus `fdl libtorch download --cpu`. What it buys is that a tree
//! which cannot compile never reaches the fleet, where N boxes would each
//! discover it separately, in logs nobody is watching.
//!
//! It proves the tree for the CONTROLLER's variant only. A break that
//! exists solely under `--features rocm` passes a CUDA gate and lands on
//! a worker; superset check, not a proof.
