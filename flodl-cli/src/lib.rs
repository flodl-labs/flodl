//! flodl-cli — library side of the `fdl` binary.
//!
//! This crate is both a library and a binary. The binary (`fdl`) is the
//! user-facing driver; the library exposes the pieces that other crates
//! (e.g. a flodl-based training binary) need to integrate with the
//! `fdl` ecosystem:
//!
//! - [`FdlArgs`] — derive macro + trait for argv parsing and schema emission
//! - [`parse_or_schema`] — intercepts `--fdl-schema` / `--help` and dispatches
//! - [`Schema`], [`OptionSpec`], [`ArgSpec`] — the canonical schema shape
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use flodl_cli::{FdlArgs, parse_or_schema};
//!
//! /// My training binary.
//! #[derive(FdlArgs, Debug)]
//! struct Cli {
//!     /// Model to run.
//!     #[option(short = 'm', default = "all")]
//!     model: String,
//!
//!     /// Write a report instead of training.
//!     #[option(default = "runs/report.md")]
//!     report: Option<String>,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let cli: Cli = parse_or_schema();
//!     // ... use cli.model, cli.report, etc.
//! }
//! ```

// Self-alias: the `#[derive(FdlArgs)]` macro emits `::flodl_cli::...`
// paths. That resolves automatically when the derive is used from a
// downstream crate (or from `main.rs`, which sees the lib as an external
// dep), but inside the library itself the compiler only knows the
// crate by its `crate`-root name. The alias makes `::flodl_cli::...`
// resolve to ourselves so `builtins.rs` can derive the same trait.
