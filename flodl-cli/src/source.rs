//! The training source: a spec, a local tree, a build.
//!
//! A box that compiles its own training binary links against the exact
//! libtorch it holds, which is what makes the ABI match by construction
//! rather than by manifest discipline. It needs the tree on LOCAL disk
//! first: cargo fingerprints by stat'ing every source file on every
//! invocation, so building over a network mount pays that latency
//! thousands of times before a line compiles, and the attribute caching
//! that would fix the latency makes cargo miss real changes and hand
//! back a stale binary.
//!
//! So a mount is a transport for the fetch, never a compile location,
//! and every spec lands the same way: materialise into a local
//! directory, then build there. One code path, which is why the dev loop
//! is exercised by the production path instead of being a second mode.
//!
//! **The fetch must preserve mtimes.** A copy that stamps every file
//! fresh makes cargo rebuild everything, so the loop silently degrades
//! to cold builds while still looking incremental. `rsync -a` preserves
//! them; a git fetch plus checkout only writes what changed. Both
//! behave, and nothing else here is allowed to.
