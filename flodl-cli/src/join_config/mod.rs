//! `fdl join-config` — the once-per-farm wizard.
//!
//! The controller side of provisioning a walk-in fleet, assembled in one
//! pass instead of from guide prose: the farm overlay (`fdl.<label>.yml`,
//! token stamped), an ed25519 join key born in `./.fdl/<label>/` so it
//! cannot be shared across farms by construction, the guardrailed
//! `authorized_keys` line for the chosen door, the paste-ready worker
//! yml, a publish recipe derived from the training crate's own manifest,
//! and a build-freshness report.
//!
//! A farm IS an env overlay: `fdl @<label> <cmd>` targets it with the
//! machinery that already exists (deep-merge onto the base fdl.yml,
//! `inherit-from:` for shared bases, `fdl config show` provenance).
//! The wizard only ever *scaffolds* an overlay or replaces a `token:`
//! value textually — a user's yml is mostly comments, and a serde
//! round-trip would delete every one of them.
//!
//! Secret hygiene: the private key goes ONLY to 0600 files under the
//! farm dir (which self-gitignores); stdout gets the public line and the
//! worker yml. `--json` reports secrets as file paths, never payloads.
//!
//! Two read-only companions serve scripted and GUI callers: `--list`
//! enumerates the project's farms with their credential state, and
//! `--dry-run` runs the full pass with every write withheld, reporting
//! what an apply would create, update or leave alone. Neither ever
//! prompts.
