# Upgrading to floDl 0.5.0

floDl 0.5.0 is the **fdl CLI maturity pass**. The framework API stays
compatible with 0.4.0; the only breaking change lives in the `fdl.yml`
manifest and the `#[derive(FdlArgs)]` attribute contract.

This document is a quick upgrade guide. For the full per-change log,
see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); for the framework's public surface,
nothing you wrote against 0.4.0 needs to change unless you were using
`#[derive(FdlArgs)]` with one of the flags now reserved.

---

## TL;DR

1. Rename `scripts:` → `commands:` in your `fdl.yml`, wrapping each
   value in a `run:` field.
2. If any `#[derive(FdlArgs)]` struct has a field named `help`,
   `version`, `quiet`, or `env` (or short-flagged `h`, `V`, `q`, `v`,
   `e`), rename it.
3. Optional: rename `fdl.dev.yml` / `fdl.ci.yml` style files you had
   been selecting manually -- `fdl --env <name>` now loads them
   automatically.

That's it. Everything else is additive.

---

## 1. `scripts:` → `commands:` in `fdl.yml`

In 0.4.0, `fdl.yml` had two top-level maps:

- `scripts:` -- shell-string commands, no docker wrapping.
- `commands:` -- docker-wrapped entries with structured config.

In 0.5.0 these are merged into one **`commands:` map** with three
kinds, chosen by which fields the entry sets: `run:` (shell), `path:`
(nested project), or preset (`ddp:` / `training:` / `output:` /
`options:` merging over an enclosing `entry:`).

### Minimal migration

```yaml
# 0.4.0 ---------------------------------------------------
scripts:
  fmt: cargo fmt --all
  lint: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

commands:
  test:
    docker: dev
    run: cargo test --features cuda

# 0.5.0 ---------------------------------------------------
commands:
  fmt:
    run: cargo fmt --all
  lint:
    run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  test:
    docker: dev
    run: cargo test --features cuda
```

### Rules of the three kinds

| Kind    | Set                              | Argv forwarded? | Notes                                                           |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `run:`  | `run:` (optionally `docker:`)    | **no**          | Closed script; use shell `$VAR` inside. `docker:` is allowed here only. |
| `path:` | `path:` (or empty + sibling dir) | yes             | Nested project with its own `fdl.yml`; forwarded argv validated against its `entry:` schema. |
| preset  | neither `run:` nor `path:`       | yes             | Only legal inside a `path:`-kind sub-command's own `fdl.yml`. Deep-merges `ddp:` / `training:` / `output:` / `options:` over the enclosing defaults. |

Common gotchas:

- **`docker:` on a non-`run:` entry** now errors at load time. Move the
  `docker:` field onto the `run:` entry it belongs to, or onto the
  sub-command's own `fdl.yml` at the top level.
- **Extra argv after `fdl <cmd> ...`** is **not** forwarded to a `run:`
  entry. If you relied on `fdl my-script foo bar` passing `foo bar` to
  the shell, switch to either `$FDL_EXTRA_ARGS` inside the script, or
  migrate the entry to a `path:` kind with a typed `entry:` binary.
- **Auto-bootstrap**: if only `fdl.yml.example` is checked in, `fdl`
  now offers to copy it to a real (gitignored) `fdl.yml` on first run.

Load-time errors tell you exactly which file, which key, and which
rule failed.

## 2. Reserved CLI flags in `#[derive(FdlArgs)]`

In 0.4.0, a struct field named `help` silently overrode `--help`. In
0.5.0 the following longs and shorts are **reserved** and cannot be
shadowed; collisions error at derive time:

- Longs: `--help`, `--version`, `--quiet`, `--env`
- Shorts: `-h`, `-V`, `-q`, `-v`, `-e`

If you have a struct like this:

```rust
// 0.4.0
#[derive(FdlArgs)]
struct Args {
    #[option]
    help: Option<String>,   // will fail to compile in 0.5.0
}
```

rename the field:

```rust
// 0.5.0
#[derive(FdlArgs)]
struct Args {
    #[option(short = 'H')]   // a non-reserved short, if you need one
    help_text: Option<String>,
}
```

The short-flag derivation is automatic from the long name's first
letter; if that first letter is reserved, pass `short = '...'`
explicitly or let the derive skip the short.

---

## 3. Environment overlays (optional, new)

If you already maintained per-environment `fdl.yml` files manually
(e.g. `fdl.local.yml`, `fdl.ci.yml`), 0.5.0 now loads them on top of
the base via:

```bash
fdl --env ci test         # explicit flag
FDL_ENV=ci fdl test       # env var
fdl ci test               # first-arg convention, if fdl.ci.yml exists
                          # and "ci" is not also a command name
```

Nothing breaks if you don't use this -- overlays are purely additive.
`fdl config show [env]` prints the resolved merged config with
per-layer origin annotations, which is the fastest way to verify a
new overlay before running a long job.

---

## 4. New top-level commands (informational)

None of these replace existing commands; they are new conveniences
that existed as no-ops or were simply absent in 0.4.0:

- `fdl config show [env]` -- resolved YAML with origin annotations.
- `fdl schema list | clear [<cmd>] | refresh [<cmd>]` -- manage the
  per-command schema cache.
- `fdl autocomplete` -- one-shot installer for shell completions.
- `--refresh-schema` per-invocation flag to refresh one entry's cache
  without a manual `fdl schema refresh`.

---

## 5. `flodl-cli-macros` on crates.io

0.5.0 adds one new published crate:

- [`flodl-cli-macros`](https://crates.io/crates/flodl-cli-macros) --
  the proc-macro derive for `FdlArgs`, re-exported by
  [`flodl-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/flodl-cli) as
  `flodl_cli::FdlArgs`. Downstream binaries depend on `flodl-cli`,
  not on this crate directly.

`flodl-cli` itself was already published on crates.io in earlier
versions; 0.5.0 bumps it along with the rest of the workspace.

You can install the CLI with `cargo install flodl-cli` or via the
pre-compiled bootstrap: `curl -sL https://flodl.dev/fdl -o fdl`.

---

## 6. Framework changes

No breaking changes to the `flodl` crate in 0.5.0. The CHANGELOG has
no `### Removed` or `### Changed (breaking)` entries outside of the
CLI / manifest scope above.

If you're upgrading from 0.3.0 or earlier, read through CHANGELOG.md
from your version forward -- the 0.4.0 entry is the larger one on the
framework side.
