# Cloud DDP — Communication-Efficient Distributed Training

The next DDP iteration targets **cloud and cross-datacenter** training,
where network latency (not GPU compute) dominates wall time, hardware
is heterogeneous across workers, and any single node can disappear
mid-epoch. Current flodl DDP is a single-host story: NCCL AllReduce
over PCIe / NVLink finishes in microseconds and `overhead_target=0.10`
is trivial. On a cross-region link, one AllReduce can cost *seconds*,
so sync-every-step becomes impractical and cadence-every-10-batches
still wastes time. `max_batch_diff` and `max_overshoot` are pairwise
guards that don't generalize to N>2 ranks, and a straggler or failed
node has no defined recovery path.

The design closes these gaps along two axes. A **communication
unlock** (outer optimizer on pseudo-gradients) widens how many local
steps each worker can take between sync rounds, cutting the number of
AllReduces per epoch by up to an order of magnitude. A **scaling
unlock** (meta-step rendezvous) replaces pairwise guards and
single-device anchor election with a participation-closed superstep
plus a predictive scheduler, addressing both heterogeneity and fault
handling. Together they make cloud DDP viable at N>2 heterogeneous
nodes with bounded convergence and graceful failure.

## Outer optimizer on pseudo-gradients

flodl's current `ElChe` cadence averages parameters directly (Local SGD
/ FedAvg semantics). This produces the implicit-regularization boost
already observed empirically (nccl-cadence reaches higher test accuracy
than solo on ResNet-20 CIFAR-10 at the same seed) but leaves the
communication-efficiency half on the table.

[DiLoCo (DeepMind, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08105) closes that
gap with a two-level optimizer: inner AdamW for H local steps per
worker, outer Nesterov momentum running on the **parameter-space drift**
between sync rounds. The pseudo-gradient (`Δ_k = θ_global - θ_k`) is
treated as a gradient by the outer optimizer; its momentum buffer
smooths the consensus direction across rounds. This unlocks H up to
~500 without divergence, an order of magnitude wider than plain
parameter averaging tolerates.

Every round saved is one AllReduce not performed on the internet.

### API

```rust
Ddp::builder(...)
    .policy(ApplyPolicy::Cadence)
    .outer_optimizer(|| NesterovMomentum::new(lr = 0.7, mu = 0.9))
    .max_anchor(500)                    // H, widen aggressively
    .run()?;
```

Mechanically, the outer optimizer hooks in at the coordinator, between
the AllReduce (or CPU snapshot average) and the parameter broadcast
back to workers. flodl already snapshots parameters at averaging events
(CPU backend) and computes cross-worker deltas for divergence
monitoring, so the outer-optimizer state buffer is a small addition on
top.

### Design targets

- **`OuterOptimizer` trait**: `step(&mut self, global: &[Tensor], worker_deltas: &[Vec<Tensor>]) -> Vec<Tensor>`.
  Returns the new global parameters.
- **Built-ins**: `NesterovMomentum` (DiLoCo default), `OuterSgd`
  (momentum=0 baseline for ablation), `OuterAdam` (sanity-check).
- **Stateless variant**: `OuterAvg` exactly replicates today's
  weighted-AllReduce behavior so existing code is unchanged when no
  outer optimizer is set.
- **Checkpoints**: the outer-optimizer state (momentum buffer) persists
  across training runs through the existing checkpoint path.

## Meta-step rendezvous

At 2 GPUs, `max_batch_diff` (Cadence) and `max_overshoot` (Async) are
pairwise guards and the anchor is a single-device election. Neither
generalizes cleanly to N>2 with heterogeneous links, where PCIe
contention, NCCL ring transit, and network jitter can shift the
effective bottleneck between rounds. The architecture that scales
splits the problem into **invariants** (the existing guards, unchanged)
and a **scheduler** (ElChe, now predictive).

### Participation-closed superstep

A *meta-step* is the interval between two instants at which every
active rank has completed at least one AllReduce since the previous
boundary. In full sync mode that is exactly one AllReduce. In async /
Cadence mode the meta-step length emerges from whichever participant
rejoined the group last. All tuning decisions (anchor weights, cadence
adjustment, dispersion evaluation) fire at meta-step boundaries;
between boundaries, policy is fixed.

This buys two properties. First, **measurement freshness**: dispersion
across ranks is only semantically clean when every rank has a recent
weight snapshot, which the participation-closure definition guarantees
at each boundary. Second, **natural hysteresis**: no single signal
moves the anchor mid-flight, because the only decision points are
after the full group has been heard from.

### Invariants stay pairwise, scheduler scales

`max_batch_diff` and `max_overshoot` remain local pairwise bounds,
empirically proven and retained unchanged. They apply *within* a
meta-step, where the participation-closure definition already bounds
heterogeneity of state. They act as safety limiters: under nominal
conditions, ElChe's scheduling keeps actuals well inside the guard
envelope; a guard firing is the signal that the predictor was wrong
and the next meta-step should retune.

All N>2 complexity moves into the scheduler, which is well-studied
territory (HPC job scheduling, work-stealing, BSP with fault
tolerance).

### Wall-time prediction

ElChe's job is to produce aligned close-times for every rank in the
next meta-step. The inputs are a joint prediction over `(device,
dispatch size, expected sync cost)`: EMA on per-batch compute
wall-time plus EMA on transfer cost per byte per link. Dispatch time
itself participates in the cost model, so the feedback loop closes:
biased schedules show up as biased predictions and self-correct.

Cold start dispatches uniformly in meta-step 0 to collect samples.
Subsequent meta-steps use the running prediction to size each rank's
chunk so that predicted close-times align within a target window.
Prediction error is surfaced as first-class telemetry: persistent
one-sided residuals indicate the scheduler is biasing the workload and
is a knob worth tuning on.

The per-link latency signal the predictor already needs subsumes a
"bandwidth-aware Cadence anchor" as a special case: when the binding
constraint is a slow link rather than a slow GPU, the EMA on transfer
cost per byte surfaces it naturally and the scheduler sizes around it.

### Reschedule on breach

If a rank runs past its predicted wall-time budget within a meta-step,
two options close the meta-step cleanly:

- **Work-steal** (default): the unfinished shard migrates to the
  fastest available GPU and replays. The meta-step sees the full data
  shard; convergence math is unchanged. Cost: re-dispatch machinery.
- **Graceful exclusion** (escape hatch): close the meta-step without
  the laggard and re-weight the average over actual participants.
  Used only when replay would itself exceed the meta-step budget.
  Introduces per-meta-step sample-weight variance; documented
  degradation.

Failure detection is the same signal: a rank that exceeds its
predicted budget by a threshold is promoted from *late* to *failed*
and reschedule kicks in. No separate health-ping channel needed.

### Two-layer control

The whole structure is a control-theoretic hierarchy: a *soft*
predictive scheduler (ElChe sizing work so close-times align) and
*hard* safety guards (`max_batch_diff`, `max_overshoot`) that bound
what can go wrong inside a single meta-step. The scheduler handles
adaptivity and scales with N; the guards handle worst-case bounds and
stay pairwise. Decoupling the two is what keeps the convergence
argument simple as the cluster grows.

### Positioning

This is a BSP superstep with the barrier relaxed from
wall-clock-global to participation-closure, plus an online wall-time
predictor and work-stealing on budget breach. Against the MSF lineage,
HetSeq and Cannikin fix cadence and let divergence emerge; the
meta-step architecture bounds divergence by construction (via the
retained guards) and lets cadence emerge from heterogeneity. Two
orthogonal axes, same problem.

## Cloud-specific primitives (follow-on)

Once outer optimizer and meta-step are in place, the remaining cloud
DDP stack is additive:

- **Gradient / delta compression**: top-K sparsification, 1-bit
  quantization, error-feedback accumulators. Works cleanly on
  pseudo-gradients because the outer optimizer absorbs the quantization
  noise.
- **Nested meta-steps (hierarchical ElChe)**: an intra-host meta-step
  with tight-cadence NCCL nested inside an inter-host meta-step with
  loose-cadence DiLoCo. One heterogeneous cluster, two
  participation-closure levels. The wall-time predictor operates at
  the outer level; the inner level reuses today's single-host ElChe.
- **Parameter-server / fully-async rounds**: drop the rendezvous
  barrier entirely and submit deltas with a staleness bound. Harder
  to reason about than meta-step async, so offered as an opt-in when
  the outer optimizer's noise tolerance is enough to absorb the
  staleness.
- **Byzantine-tolerant aggregation** (optional): trimmed mean /
  median instead of weighted mean for untrusted workers (federated /
  open-contribution training).

## Why this matters for flodl

Most DDP framework docs sell "faster multi-GPU." The empirical data
already gathered shows flodl's cadence mode is *already* winning on
generalization at the single-host scale, which is the same mechanism
frontier labs are reaching for at the trillion-parameter scale with
DiLoCo and its descendants. Pairing that outer-optimizer pattern with
the meta-step architecture positions flodl's `ElChe` as the complete
story: heterogeneous-hardware-aware, fault-tolerant,
network-efficient, generalization-improving DDP out of the box, from
2 GPUs on a workstation to a multi-region cluster.
