//! DDP run mode: thread-per-GPU training with Local SGD and adaptive parameter averaging.
//!
//! Each GPU runs its own optimizer independently (zero wait). A lightweight coordinator
//! triggers periodic parameter averaging at ElChe-determined intervals. Two orthogonal
//! knobs control the behavior: [`ApplyPolicy`] (when to average) and [`AverageBackend`]
//! (how to average).
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use flodl::*;
//!
//! let handle = Ddp::builder(model_factory, optim_factory, train_fn)
//!     .dataset(dataset)
//!     .batch_size(32)
//!     .num_epochs(10)
//!     .policy(ApplyPolicy::Cadence)
//!     .backend(AverageBackend::Nccl)
//!     .checkpoint_every(5)
//!     .checkpoint_fn(|ver, g| g.save_checkpoint(&format!("ckpt_v{ver}.fdl")))
//!     .run()?;
//!
//! let state = handle.join()?;
//! // state.params[i] corresponds to model.parameters()[i]
//! // state.buffers[i] corresponds to model.buffers()[i]
//! ```
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! GPU Thread 0:  create model+Adam+dataset -> [fwd -> bwd -> adam step -> repeat]
//! GPU Thread 1:  create model+Adam+dataset -> [fwd -> bwd -> adam step -> repeat]
//! Coordinator:   collect timing/metrics -> trigger param averaging -> monitor divergence
//! ```
//!
//! # Choosing a policy
//!
//! | Policy | When to use | Tradeoff |
//! |--------|-------------|----------|
//! | [`ApplyPolicy::Sync`] | Correctness-first, small models, homogeneous GPUs | Identical to standard DDP. Fast GPU waits at every batch. |
//! | [`ApplyPolicy::Cadence`] | Heterogeneous GPUs (e.g. Pascal + Blackwell) | Fast GPU runs ahead by ElChe-determined batches. Good throughput/convergence balance. |
//! | [`ApplyPolicy::Async`] | Maximum throughput, large models, fault tolerance | Averaging interval auto-tunes from divergence monitoring. Best for experienced users. |
//!
//! # Choosing a backend
//!
//! | Backend | When to use | Tradeoff |
//! |---------|-------------|----------|
//! | [`AverageBackend::Nccl`] | Default choice. NVLink/PCIe peer-to-peer. | In-place AllReduce, zero extra memory, hard sync at averaging point. |
//! | [`AverageBackend::Cpu`] | No NVLink, A/B testing, debugging, CPU-only setups | Params copied to CPU for averaging. No GPU blocks, but uses O(world_size * model_size) CPU RAM and adds latency from GPU-CPU-GPU round-trip. |
//!
//! Start with `Cadence` + `Nccl` for heterogeneous setups, `Sync` + `Nccl` for
//! homogeneous. Use `Cpu` backend when debugging or when NCCL is unavailable.
//!
//! # Safety guards
//!
//! - [`with_max_batch_diff`](DdpRunConfig::with_max_batch_diff): hard limit on how far any GPU can
//!   run ahead. Set to `0` for strict lockstep. Prevents catastrophic divergence
//!   with large batches or extreme speed ratios.
//! - [`ElChe`](super::ddp::ElChe) adaptive speed tracking with dead-zone hysteresis:
//!   tolerates thermal jitter while adapting quickly to sustained speed changes.
//! - NCCL abort handles: if a worker dies mid-collective, surviving workers are
//!   unblocked via `ncclCommAbort` instead of hanging forever.
