//! Dial-in membership: the join window that forms a training world.
//!
//! Workers join; the controller admits. A worker agent dials the
//! controller's single mux port with [`CHANNEL_MAGIC_JOIN`], sends a
//! [`JoinMsgWire::Hello`], and is validated immediately — version skew
//! (frame layer), dataset signature, duplicate host, capacity abuse are
//! all rejected loudly at the door. Admitted workers get their global
//! rank ids in admission order, which keeps the rank space contiguous
//! by construction: the first joiner with `k` GPUs holds `0..k`, the
//! next `m`-GPU joiner holds `k..k+m`, and `world_size` is simply the
//! total when the window closes. No holes, no compaction.
//!
//! # Window semantics (quorum knobs)
//!
//! The world is formed once, at start, governed by [`JoinConfig`]:
//!
//! - **`min_rank_start`** — the quorum, counted in ranks. The run
//!   cannot start below it.
//! - **`join_timeout_secs`** — the join window. Reaching quorum early
//!   does NOT close the window: late workers within it are still
//!   admitted. More capacity is never refused while the door is open.
//! - **`target_ranks`** — optional early close the moment it is
//!   reached. When the launcher started exactly N ranks' worth of
//!   workers, the run starts the moment all N are in.
//! - **`max_join_timeout_secs`** — the hard cap. Between the window and
//!   the cap the controller waits for quorum only: the first moment
//!   quorum is met in that range, the world forms. Past the cap with
//!   quorum unmet, the run fails loudly.
//!
//! Both timeouts scale with `FLODL_NET_TIMEOUT_SCALE` like the rest of
//! the deadline set.
//!
//! # Trust: how join frames are keyed
//!
//! The join channel is the one channel a peer may dial without holding
//! the session salt (that is the point — open admission hands the salt
//! out in the [`JoinMsgWire::Accept`] reply). Pre-admission frames are
//! keyed by the trust mode (see [`join_frame_key`]):
//!
//! - **pre-shared** (fan-out rig mode): the session salt. A hello keyed
//!   with anything else fails frame authentication and is rejected —
//!   same guarantee as every other channel.
//! - **open admission** (loopback bind behind sshd, or explicit
//!   `open_admission: true`): an all-zeros key. The MAC still enforces
//!   protocol conformance and integrity, but authentication comes from
//!   the bind scope — reachability through sshd proves possession of an
//!   authorized SSH key.
//!
//! Post-admission frames ([`JoinMsgWire::WorldFormed`] and later) are
//! always keyed with the session salt, binding the connection to the
//! admitted identity.
//!
