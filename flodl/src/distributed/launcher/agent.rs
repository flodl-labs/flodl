//! Per-host worker agent: dial in, join, then run the host.
//!
//! The agent is the worker-side half of dial-in membership. It is the
//! ONLY process fan-out (or a cloud startup script, or a human shell)
//! needs to start on a worker host: it dials the controller's mux port
//! on the join channel, sends a hello, and — once the world is formed —
//! receives the exact artifacts the launcher used to ship at spawn time
//! (the slim per-host envelope and the relay spec) and spawns its relay
//! and rank children locally with them. Everything downstream of world
//! formation is byte-identical to the direct fan-out era; ranks never
//! know the join protocol exists.
//!
//! After spawning, the agent stays up as the host supervisor: it
//! forwards its children's output (prefixed, exactly as the launcher's
//! per-rank forwarders did), reports every rank child's exit upstream
//! as [`JoinMsgWire::RankExited`] (per-rank granularity for the
//! controller's elastic membership — the join connection's EOF alone
//! would only signal whole-host death), and tears the host down on a
//! controller [`JoinMsgWire::Abort`].
//!
//! The agent touches no CUDA: GPU inventory comes from
//! [`crate::sys::detect_gpus`] (an out-of-process vendor probe),
//! honoring the "no CUDA
//! before `Trainer::run`" invariant — the agent process never trains.
